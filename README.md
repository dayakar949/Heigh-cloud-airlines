# Heigh-cloud-airlines
This project focuses on analyzing airline flight operations using a real-world dataset containing over 110,000 records and 54 columns. The dataset includes airline carrier details, origin and destination airports, cities, states, route information, and date fields such as year, month, and day, mainly representing domestic airline operations (primarily Alaska routes). The objective of this project is to clean and preprocess the data, analyze flight routes, identify frequently traveled paths, study monthly and yearly travel trends, and build interactive dashboards using Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and Python. Through this analysis, key operational insights were generated, including high-traffic routes, seasonal travel patterns, and major airport hubs. This project helped strengthen practical skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, dashboard creation, and transforming raw data into meaningful business insights.
